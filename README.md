# speedTest Vs others

SpeedTest is entirely JS & HTML5 powered, this means it is compatible on ALL platforms!

The SpeedTest App For Android is powered the same way, but formatted differently. The goal with that is to offer a light app easy to use, and easy to reach. 

SpeedTest now uses some 3rd party components but many of them are open source. 

The Portable Version or Basic Bare Bones version which you can use on your site, doesn't have any 3rd party components. 

Some Third-Party Components:

*Main Project*

  - ClipBoard.js (Allows you to copy your results)
  
  - Li.IO (Provides your IP address more accurate)
  
  - One-Signal (Notifications)
  
 *Android App*
  
   - Cordova PhoneGap (Powers the App)
   
   - One-Signal (Notifications)
   
   - ClipBoard.js (Allows you to copy your results)
   
   - Li.IO (Provides your IP address more accurate)
   
# Installation 

Installing is pretty easy. All you have to do is go [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Pages/portable.html) and follow the directions - There is even a extender guide, to get the most out of this project for your own use. 

This is a live project meaning it isn't really a library - but you can def. use this in your project but following that guide. 

CSS as well as set up is on you. All other design is copyrighted. And shouldn't be used. Please incorporate your own project. The portable version is for those who want or need such utility. 
   
# Version info. 

- See the full change log <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/Change-Log">Here</a>

**SpeedTest is tested on up to 24 mbps peak speeds, this means, your results could become innaccurate if your speeds are larger peaks than 24** 

**Project is not complete, means it can perform poorly sometimes**
